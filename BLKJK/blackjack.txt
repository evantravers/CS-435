	cards 1-13
	1 is a special card. Could be 1, could be 11. Either x or x+10
	
	(RN/100000000_16)*13+1 generates numbers between 1 and 13.
	
	we take our current state, and then run a dartboard sim on it for stand, hit, double.
	to determine the odds of the hands, x = (-1+1-1+0+0+1)/n
	
	eventually we want to match the charts on the site, roughly.
	
	there are two ways to handle this:
		static scheduling (bad)
			blind division, before the work is allocated
			
		dynamic scheduling (good)
			reasonably sized chunks, keeping in mind the amount of effort required
			
	obviously, sending only one hand doesn't utilize the resources given well.
	
	Send 3 cards, (your two, dealers up) and the number of hands.
	You'll need to do quite a few trials
	
	computing blackjack odds:
		only three options (max)
			double
				double the risk, take on card, then goes on like stand.(IMPORTANT +2,-2/n_trials)
			hit
				for each option, fork off another choice, hit/stand, recursively return the better choice.
			stand
				this will go quick, as the only action is the dealer hits until 17
				
	Remember that you will be floating point.
	
	Level of correctness: correct order, correct range.
	The real question is: how to divide the work up evenly to maximize profit.
