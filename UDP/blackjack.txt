	cards 1-13
	1 is a special card. Could be 1, could be 11. 
	
	(RN/100000000_16)*13+1 generates numbers between 1 and 13.
	
	we take our current state, and then run a dartboard sim on it for stand, hit, double.
	to determine the odds of the hands, x = (-1+1-1+0+0+1)/n
	
	eventually we want to match the charts on the site, roughly.
	
	there are two ways to handle this:
		static scheduling (bad)
			blind division, before the work is allocated
			
		dynamic scheduling (good)
			reasonably sized chunks, keeping in mind the amount of effort required
			
	obviously, sending only one hand doesn't utilize the resources given well.
